# eltpython

A ELT pipeline using Python where the source files are first cleaned and stored in as tables in a 'tempdb' temporary SQL server database. Cleaning and pre-processing is done in Python, followed by extraction and loaded in PostgreSQL database. Once the tables have been loaded in PostgreSQL, answers to few questions and insights have been observed using SQL queries.
